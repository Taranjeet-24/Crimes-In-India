Crime is a serious issue that affects everyone in society. It affects the victims, perpetrators and their families. Crime has increased drastically within the last decade. More prisons are being built around the world because there is not enough room to hold inmates. The government has made an attempt to reduce crime by funding programs such as prevention and intervention for youth at risk , as well as rehabilitation for prisoners that will be released. Some argue that criminal behavior is due to environment, others believe that it is genetic, and yet others think that it has to do with personality.
For youth age 13 and 14, the number was 671,900; and youth age 15 and older accounted for 1,929,800 arrests (Federal Probation, 1996). As mentioned earlier, being able to identify personality traits that tend to lead to delinquency is clearly one option to the reduction of crime. However, the problem is that many youth display similar negative behavior during adolescence. This includes negative attitude, different interests, and a need for privacy. The key is to be involved in the life of today’s youth. Communicating with them, spending time with them and knowing what they are involved in is part of the process. According to Peace Research Abstracts Journal, (1999) helping youth finds meaning in their lives often involves building connectedness-restoring relationships with others, with their sense of spirituality and with earth. Parents must also be aware of the warning signs and follow up on them. Warning signs in youth include showing lack of interest in family/school activities, truancy problems and poor school performance, signs of aggression, and negative peer relationships. When the parent acknowledges this behavior, the parent can takes steps to improve it, or at least stop it from getting worse. Individual counseling, and family therapy allows the family to learn how to deal with the youth’s antisocial personality and possible delinquent behavior. A number of studies have addressed the question of general Therapeutic effectiveness
